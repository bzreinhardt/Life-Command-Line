# Life Command Line
This is just a set of command line tools for common things I do on the computer
I alias them so they're even faster: current `~/.bash_profile` contains:
`
alias who='python ~/Code/life-command-line/find_linkedin_address.py'
alias intro='python ~/Code/life-command-line/compose_intro_email.py'
alias mountain='python ~/Code/life-command-line/find_mountain_project.py'
alias upload='python ~/Code/life-command-line/upload_picture_to_s3.py'
`
